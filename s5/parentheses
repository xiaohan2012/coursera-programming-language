#lang racket
;Racket has amazingly simple syntax
;the basic construct of the syntax is term
;term is 
;1, atomic, like 1 "12" #t #f, anything undividable
;2, special form, like keyword, lambda, define,..
;3, a sequence of terms in paren: (t1 t2 ...tn), 
; note, if t is not a speical form, then it is a function.

;because of this syntax, the syntax tree is easy to get
;note operator priority is of no need in tree construction
