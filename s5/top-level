#lang racket

; like ML, Racket can back reference bindings
; unlike ML, Racket can also forward reference bindings, unless the referred bindings are in the function body

(define x 1)
(define y (+ x 1)) ;back reference ok
(define (f x) (+ x y z)) ;forward reference, ok
;(define a (+ x z)) ;not ok, because it is not in the function body
(define z 2)
;(define f 5) ; not ok, because of duplicate definition of `f`
